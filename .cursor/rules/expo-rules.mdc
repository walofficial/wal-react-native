8. Make sure to use industry standars when asked or you are have to do some UI or UX change
9. Adjust the image size appropriately when asked about adjusting or something and use correct design guidelines, I like Apple human interface guidelines, on Android try to use Material
10. When asked about some chat components UX or chat functionality use inspiration from Signal or Facebook Messenger UI
11. You should make sure to follow Rules of Hooks e.g do not use it inside the functions call inside react component
12. When you design stuff and apply colors text, use everything from main theme to support light mode and dark mode
13. Use CSS native boxShadow instead of shadow properties
